Big Data Training Package – Code Repository
Overview

This repository contains the complete set of practical code examples used in the Big Data Training Package (Big Data). The code is designed to support hands-on learning and applied understanding of big data concepts, tools, and platforms, as delivered in a professional training context.

The repository focuses on translating theoretical concepts into executable examples, enabling learners and practitioners to explore real-world data workflows, distributed computing environments, and modern data platforms through guided code implementations.

Scope of the Repository

The code in this repository covers applied examples related to:

Fundamental concepts of Big Data and data types (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)

NoSQL databases and document-based data handling

Distributed computing principles

Hadoop ecosystem basics

Apache Spark processing

Databricks platform usage

Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers)

Data ingestion, organization, integration, and analysis workflows

Practical data quality exploration and validation examples

All code examples are organized to align with the logical progression of the training modules and are intended for instructional and learning purposes.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic and platform, following a clear and progressive structure. Each folder typically contains:

Executable notebooks or scripts

Sample datasets (where applicable)

Supporting files required to run the examples

The structure is intentionally kept simple to allow learners to follow the training flow without unnecessary complexity.

Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

Trainees enrolled in professional Big Data training programs

Data practitioners seeking practical exposure to Big Data tools

Analysts and technical professionals interested in applied data engineering concepts

Learners exploring distributed data processing and modern data platforms

A basic familiarity with data concepts and programming fundamentals is recommended, but the examples are designed to be instructional and accessible.

How to Use

Clone or download the repository.

Review the folder structure and start with the introductory examples.

Run the notebooks or scripts in the appropriate environment (local setup, virtual machine, or cloud platform such as Databricks).

Follow the code comments and execution flow to understand each step.

Modify and experiment with the code to deepen practical understanding.

Technical Notes

Some examples require specific environments (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Databricks).

Cloud-based execution is recommended for distributed processing examples.

Datasets included are for educational purposes only.

Intellectual Property and Usage
